<!-- About the Project -->
## ðŸŒŸ About the Project

This is a start kit built using NextJS and Tailwind CSS. I use this starter kit for any new projects I want to build with a React core and to ultimately host within AWS Amplify.

Currently AWS Amplify has issues supporting the API of NextJS on Versions > 12.0.8 (at time of writing on 26th Apr 2022), hence why this is using NextJS V12.0.8

I've added in [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) as well as Tailwinds [Headless UI](https://headlessui.dev/react/tabs)
